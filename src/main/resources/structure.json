Another example for this usage might be a digital file created from a VHS tape that contains multiple segments. In the digital copy, color bars are removed from the beginning, and black from the end of the digital instantiation.

When used at the asset level, it may be used to talk generally about the start/end time of a segment (e.g. \"30 minutes\"), or by providing a timestamp to a specific point in an instantiation. If you're doing that for element at the asset level, we suggest referencing the instantiation ID you are referring to in timeAnnotation. One example would be if a six-hour long tape was broken into multiple programs, and each instantiation might have its start time labeled as when the instantiation began in the timeline of the broader tape. Another example for this usage might be a digital file created from a VHS tape that contains multiple segments. In the digital copy, color bars are removed from the beginning, and black from the end of the digital instantiation. Time references referring to the segments on the physical VHS are no longer relevant; therefore it's important to tie start and end time references to a specific instantiation, e.g. use the asset ID and timestamp.\n\n","readOnly":false,"value":null,"type":"PBCoreAttribute","attribute":true,"pathRepresentation":"Start Time","anyElement":false,"hasChildElements":false,"repeatable":false},{"type":"PBCoreAttribute","typeForLayout":"NORMAL","id":0,"fullPath":"pbcoreDescriptionDocument/pbcorePart/pbcoreInstantiation/instantiationPart/endTime","screenName":"End Time","name":"endTime","tooltip":null,"required":false,"description":"\n The endTime attribute combines with a similar value in the startTime attribute to define a specific media segment within a broader timeline of an asset and/or instantiation.\n\n","readOnly":false,"value":null,"type":"PBCoreAttribute","attribute":true,"pathRepresentation":"End Time","anyElement":false,"hasChildElements":false,"repeatable":false},{"type":"PBCoreAttribute","typeForLayout":"NORMAL","id":0,"fullPath":"pbcoreDescriptionDocument/pbcorePart/pbcoreInstantiation/instantiationPart/timeAnnotation","screenName":"Time Annotation","name":"timeAnnotation","tooltip":null,"required":false,"description":"\n The timeAnnotation attribute includes narrative information intended to clarify any time-oriented nature of data used in the element.\n\n","readOnly":false,"value":null,"type":"PBCoreAttribute","attribute":true,"pathRepresentation":"Time Annotation","anyElement":false,"hasChildElements":false,"repeatable":false},{"type":"PBCoreAttribute","typeForLayout":"NORMAL","id":0,"fullPath":"pbcoreDescriptionDocument/pbcorePart/pbcoreInstantiation/instantiationPart/source","screenName":"Source","name":"source","tooltip":null,"required":false,"description":"\n The source attribute provides the name of the authority used to declare the value of the element.\n\nBest practice: Different elements will use the source attribute slightly differently.
